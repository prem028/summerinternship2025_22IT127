• We worked on a dataset containing customer transaction details and applied several transformation and validation rules.

### ✅ Week 2 Task Outline:

1. **Perform Sanity Checks** – Remove null values, invalid ages, etc.  
2. **Monthly Data Split** – Convert cumulative data to month-wise format.  
3. **Customer Profiling** – Find top 10 paying customers, monthly spend/repayment.  
4. **Apply Fine Logic** – Fine of 2.9% on late repayments.  
5. **Segment Customers** – Based on spend behavior and profit contribution.  

### 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Excel (.xls)

### 📝 Day-by-Day Progress:

#### Day 1 – Dataset Understanding & Null Handling
• Loaded raw `.xls` dataset.  
• Removed null and duplicate rows.  
• Filtered invalid entries like Age < 18.  
• Converted 'Date' column to month format.

#### Day 2 – Monthly Segmentation
• Segmented the dataset month-wise.  
• Handled cumulative values and recalculated per month spend.  
• Grouped by customer and month for insights.

#### Day 3 – Spend & Repayment Calculation
• Calculated total spend and repayment for each customer.  
• Identified top 10 customers by amount repaid.  
• Filtered credit violations where repayment exceeded credit limit.

#### Day 4 – Fine Logic & Segmentation
• Applied 2.9% fine on overdue payments.  
• Segmented customers based on profitability and payment behavior.  
• Created new columns for fines, profit, and segment labels.

#### Day 5 – Report Finalization
• Created summary reports in Excel and Pandas.
